# Reducing Carbon Emission for Haier

This project focuses on optimizing Haier's supply chain to minimize carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions while adhering to a specified budget constraint. The objective is to determine the optimal configuration for the production and transportation of air conditioner (AC) units from the Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) to the Distribution Center (DC).

## Project Overview

Haier Group Corporation, a Chinese multinational home appliances and consumer electronics company, aims to achieve carbon-neutral operations globally by 2040. This project addresses the challenge of reducing carbon emissions in the transportation of AC units from manufacturing bases to the DC, while operating within a given budget.

## Problem Statement

The problem involves determining the following:

- Which ODMs will manufacture the AC units (1 ton and 1.5 ton)
- The number of units to be produced by each selected ODM
- The transportation modes (air, road freight, ship freight, and rail) to be used for shipping the AC units from the ODMs to the DC

The objective is to minimize the total cost of production and transportation while keeping carbon emissions at the lowest possible level, subject to operational and risk-related constraints.

## Constraints and Parameters

The project considers the following constraints and parameters:

- Budget: CNY 3 Billion
- Production requirements: 800,000 units of 1.5 ton AC and 600,000 units of 1 ton AC
- Minimum and maximum production orders for each ODM
- Minimum shipment orders for different transportation modes
- Production costs for each ODM and product
- Shipment costs per metric ton for each ODM and transportation mode
- CO2 emissions per ton-km shipped for each transportation mode

## Methodology

The project employs linear programming and uses the Solver add-in in Excel to find the optimal solution. The decision variables, objective function, and constraints are defined mathematically, and the solver is used to optimize the solution.

## Analysis and Results

The project provides the following analyses and results:

1. Initial solution: Optimal configuration of the supply chain within the specified budget.
2. Sensitivity analysis: Exploration of the trade-off between budget and carbon emissions, determining the budget increase required to achieve a targeted reduction in CO2 emissions.
3. Recommendations: Insights and strategies for Haier to achieve its "Go Green" target and promote sustainability in the supply chain.
